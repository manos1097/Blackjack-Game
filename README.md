# Blackjack

This is my implementation of the famous game.

I used only Python in this project.

The player's or dealer's collection of cards is called "Hand"

The purpose of the game is to have a hand's value as close to 21

If a hand's value equals to 21 the player who has the hand wins and gets the dealer's betted chips

If a hand's value exceeds 21 the player who has the hand "Busts" and losses and losses his betted chips

If a hand's value is lower than 21 then the dealer starts hitting cards until it's hand exceeds the number 17. 

The player starts with 2 cards on his hand.

The player has a decision to make. To hit or pass

Hitting gives 1 more card

Pass stop's the player's actions and give the order to the dealer

Then the dealer follows the same actions and the program announces the winner
